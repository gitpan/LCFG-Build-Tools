=head1 NAME

    LCFG::Build::Utils::OSXPkg - LCFG software building utilities

=head1 VERSION

    This documentation refers to LCFG::Build::Utils::OSXPkg version 0.4.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a suite of utilities to help in building MacOSX
packages from LCFG projects, particularly LCFG components. The methods
are mostly used by tools which implement the LCFG::Build::Tool base
class (e.g. LCFG::Build::Tool::OSXPkg) but typically they are designed to
be generic enough to be used elsewhere.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

There is one public method you can call on this class.

=over 4

=item build( $outdir, $tarfile, $dirname, $pkgname, $pkgversion, $pkgident, $filters, $scriptdir, $nopayload )

This method assumes that C<$tarfile> contains sources that C<cmake>
can build and install.  C<pkgbuild> is then called to create the
package.

=over 4

=item B<$outdir>

Absolute path to the directory where the package will be created.

=item B<$tarfile>

Absolute path to the tarfile to unpack, build and package.

=item B<$pkgname>

The full name of the package you want to generate,
e.g. C<lcfg-foo-1.2.3-4>.  C<.pkg> will be appended to this for you.

=item B<$pkgversion>

The version of the package, e.g. C<1.2.3.4>.

=item B<$pkgident>

A package identifier to pass to C<pkgbuild>, e.g. C<org.lcfg>.

=item B<$filters>

A reference to an array of filter expressions to pass to C<pkgbuild>.

=item B<$scriptdir>

Absolute path to a directory of scripts to pass to C<pkgbuild>.  There
is no filtering of the files in this directory and C<pkgbuild> will
copy all its contents into the package.

=item B<$nopayload>

A boolean that flags whether the package should be created with or
without a payload.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

For building packages you will need CMake and pkgbuild.

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.

Mac OS X 10.7

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are no known bugs in this application. Please report any
problems to bugs@lcfg.org, feedback and patches are also always very
welcome.
